  ## Description
   This application is meant to make an organized team roster that simply lays out who is on the team, what their role is, and some information about their contacts, GitHub account, or education.This node application takes user inputs using inquirer to join responses to generate an HTML file that could be used to deploy a digital roster.

  ## Installation
  This application requires a few steps prior to use, the user would need to clone the repository using a git clone and bringing the code into their own local repo. After that, the  user needs to ensure that they have node and inquirer installed. To run the application, the user would type node index.js into their terminal or CLI and the questions should  begin populating. 

  ## Usage
  1. Clone repository from GitHub
  2. Install node and inquirer to run the project
  3. Type node index.js into terminal or CLI
  4. Begin answering questions...
  5. Check the dist file for your completed index.html
